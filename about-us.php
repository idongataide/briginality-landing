                            Post after post from homeschoolers admitting they feel isolated, parents worrying about “socialization,” and teens searching for friends who understand. The conversations are endless, but the solutions? They’re scattered, expensive, or nonexistent.

                            That’s the flaw of homeschooling that no one really wants to talk about: freedom comes at the cost of connection. Without community, the independence of homeschooling can turn into isolation, and isolation makes it harder to grow, feel confident, and harder to remember that you’re not the only one living this way.

                            We’re proud to say Bridginality is completely homeschooler-run and homeschooler-owned. No corporations, or outside adults telling us what our community should look like. Just us, the students, building something real together.

                            Here, you’ll find peer-led clubs, leadership opportunities, and friendships that cross borders. From Model UN to Crochet & Fiber Arts to Women in STEM, our spaces are built by people who know what it’s like to be homeschooled, because we are!
